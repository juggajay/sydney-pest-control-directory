If organic traffic 50-100K/month:      → Implement Phase 1 + 2
If organic traffic > 100K/month:       → Implement all phases
If team < 3 people:                    → Implement Phase 1 only
If team 3-5 people:                    → Implement Phase 1 + 2
If team > 5 people:                    → Implement all phases
If revenue/lead < $1000:               → Low priority
If revenue/lead $1000-5000:            → Medium priority
If revenue/lead > $5000:               → High priority - implement now
```

**For this project:**
- Organic traffic: ~50,000/month (Medium)
