```

### Linking Impact

## COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: How long before blog posts rank?**
A: 2-6 months for new posts. Seasonal content ranks faster (1-2 weeks before season). Old posts take 3-12 months to climb. Consistent linking accelerates ranking.

**Q: Should I focus on blog or directory pages first?**
A: Both together. Blog content drives traffic to directory pages. Directory pages (suburbs, services) provide link targets. They work as a system.

**Q: How many blog posts per week?**
A: Start with 1-2 per week. Scale to 2-4 per month long-term. Quality > Quantity. One excellent 2,500-word post beats three mediocre 1,000-word posts.

**Q: Do I need to link to every suburb in every post?**
A: No, but spread suburb links across all blog posts. Target major suburbs (Bondi, Manly, Parramatta) in multiple posts. Link less-searched suburbs occasionally.

**Q: Should I create blog categories?**
A: Yes. Use folder structure: /resources/guides, /resources/case-studies, /resources/seasonal. This helps with URL structure and organization.

**Q: How often should I update old blog posts?**
A: Monthly for top-performing posts, quarterly for others. Update: statistics, links, examples, modification date. This signals freshness to Google.

**Q: Can I republish the same topic?**
A: Only if it's a different angle. Example: "Termite Guide" (pillar) vs. "Termite Prevention Tips" (sub-article). Avoid near-duplicate content.

**Q: What's the best time to publish?**
A: Tuesday-Thursday, 9am-12pm (US time if targeting Australia). But consistency matters more than timing.

**Q: Should I guest post on other sites?**
A: Not initially. Build authority on your own site first. Later, guest posts can drive backlinks (advanced strategy).

**Q: How do I measure blog ROI?**
A: Track organic traffic to blog, click-through to services/suburbs, and quote form submissions from blog traffic. Aim for 50-100% increase in directory page traffic after 6 months.
