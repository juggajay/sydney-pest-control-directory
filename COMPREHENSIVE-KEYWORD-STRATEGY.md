### Voice Search Optimization Tactics

#### 1. Conversational Content
```
Current: "Pest Control in Sydney | Licensed Operators & Reviews"
Voice-friendly: "Need pest control in Sydney? Find licensed operators near
you, compare free quotes, and get same-day service. Most respond within 2 hours."

How to implement:
- Add FAQ section with natural Q&A format
- Use conversational H2 headings ("How can I..." vs "Cost of...")
- Include long-tail, question-based keywords naturally
- Add direct answers at top of content (position zero)
```

#### 2. Snippet Optimization
```
For query: "How much does pest control cost in Sydney?"

Optimal answer (40-60 words):
"Pest control costs in Sydney typically range from $150-$350 for general
treatment in a standard home. Termite inspections cost $250-$500, while
treatments range $2,000-$5,000. Prices depend on property size, pest type,
and severity. Get free quotes from licensed operators for exact pricing."

Where to place:
- FAQ section (first in list)
- Service page introduction
- Dedicated blog post on pricing
- Operator page testimonials
```

#### 3. Local Intent Optimization
```
Add to every page:
- Local business schema (location, phone, hours)
- Keywords: "near me", "[suburb]", "[postcode]"
- Local reviews and ratings
- "Contact" or "Call now" CTAs
- Service area list

Homepage enhancement:
Add section: "Pest Control Near You in [Top 10 suburbs]"
Include: Quick suburb links with operator counts
Target keywords: voice searches for local operators
```

#### 4. Featured Snippet Targeting
```
Question: "How do I prepare for pest control?"

Optimal snippet format (list):
"To prepare for pest control treatment:
1. Remove food and pet dishes
2. Clear items away from walls and under sinks
3. Cover or remove clothing from treated areas
4. Vacuum floors thoroughly
5. Provide access to all rooms including roof spaces
6. Keep pets away from treated areas for 2-4 hours"

Implement as:
- Ordered list on service pages
- Table format on preparation guide
- Highlighted box on operator pages
```
