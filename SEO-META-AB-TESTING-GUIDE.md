## A/B TEST SCHEDULE

### Week 1: Homepage (All traffic to one variant)

**Monday:**
- Implement Option A only
- Document baseline CTR
- Set Google Search Console tracking

**Friday:**
- Review CTR data
- Check average position
- Document results

**Decision:** If CTR +5% or higher, keep. Otherwise test Option C next week.

---

### Week 2-3: Suburb Pages (50/50 split testing)

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Roughly 50% of suburbs get current template
- 50% get optimized template (randomly selected)
- OR: Split by traffic (high-traffic suburbs keep current, test new on medium-traffic)

**High-Traffic Test Suburbs (50% new, 50% old):**
- Bondi (8 operators)
- Parramatta (12 operators)
- Sydney CBD (15 operators)
- Manly (6 operators)
- Penrith (5 operators)

**Low-Traffic Control (keep current):**
- Austral (2 operators)
- Cattai (1 operator)
- Bargo (1 operator)

**Daily Monitoring:**
- Check GSC for "Pest Control Bondi", "Pest Control Parramatta" etc.
- Note position/impression changes
- Watch for quick CTR improvements

**Friday Analysis:**
- Which version (current vs new) had higher CTR?
- By how much? (+1%, +3%, +5%?)
- Any position improvements?

**Decision:** Roll out winner to all suburb pages

---

### Week 4-5: Service Pages (All pages to optimized)

**Why Not A/B?** All service pages have same truncation problem - fix is critical.

**Monday:** Roll out Option A to all service pages

**Measurement Focus:**
- Truncation issue resolution (should see immediate improvement)
- CTR on long-tail searches ("termite inspection bondi", etc.)
- Position improvements for service keywords

**Expected Quick Win:** +6-10% CTR increase due to truncation fix

---

### Week 6-7: Operator Pages (Test both options)

**Test Allocation:**
- Option A: 70% of operators (location-focused)
- Option B: 30% of operators (star rating-focused)

**Random Selection:**
- Option A: ABC Pest Control, XYZ Services, FastPest, ...
- Option B: Critter Control, PestGuard, Bugbusters, ...

**Measurement:**
- Which gets more quote form clicks?
- Which ranks higher for "[Operator] [Suburb]"?
- Which gets more phone clicks?

**Duration:** Full 2 weeks for stat significance

**Decision:**
- If Option B wins by 3%+: Roll out B to all
- If Option A wins or tie: Use A (simpler to implement)
