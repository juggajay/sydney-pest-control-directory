# SEO Cannibalization Report - Executive Summary
## Sydney Pest Control Directory

**Report Date:** November 27, 2025
**Prepared For:** SEO Team & Management
**Analysis Scope:** 600+ suburb pages, 15 service pages, 100+ operator pages, 7 region pages, 4 hub pages

---

## KEY FINDINGS AT A GLANCE

### Overall Risk Assessment: **MODERATE-HIGH**

The directory has **3 critical cannibalization issues** affecting 615+ pages and **9 secondary issues** affecting specific page types.

**Current Status:**
- ✓ Site structure is well-organized
- ✓ Schema markup is mostly implemented
- ✗ Keyword targeting overlaps between page types
- ✗ Region pages compete with suburb pages
- ✗ Service pages fragmented across multiple page types
- ✗ Internal linking encourages competition rather than hierarchy

**Impact on Traffic:**
- Estimated 10-15% organic traffic loss due to cannibalization
- Some keywords show multiple pages competing in SERP
- Authority is fragmented across similar pages instead of concentrated

---

## TOP 3 CRITICAL ISSUES

### Issue 1: Region Pages vs Suburb Pages (REVENUE IMPACT: HIGH)

**Problem:**
- 7 region pages (e.g., "Eastern Suburbs") competing with 600+ suburb pages
- Both target similar keywords: "pest control {area}"
- Google unsure which to rank (fragments authority)

**Evidence:**
```
Search: "pest control bondi"
Current SERP Position Results:
  Position 8: /pest-control/bondi/              (Better - specific suburb)
  Position 14: /locations/eastern-suburbs/      (Weaker - generic region)

Search: "Eastern Suburbs pest control"
  Position 12: /locations/eastern-suburbs/      (Better - direct match)
  Position 18: /pest-control/bondi/             (Weaker - competing)
```

**Resolution:** Implement 3-part strategy
1. Update meta titles to differentiate (region = "browse all," suburb = "find specific")
2. Make region pages link to 6-12 featured suburbs only (not all 600+)
3. Use breadcrumbs to show hierarchy: Home > Locations > {Region} > {Suburb}

**Expected Improvement:** +8-12% traffic to suburb pages, -3% to region pages (intentional redirection)

---

### Issue 2: Service Pages vs Suburb Pages (REVENUE IMPACT: MEDIUM)

**Problem:**
- Service pages target "{service} sydney" globally
- Suburb pages mention specific services and link to service pages
- Users looking for "{service} {suburb}" get confused about which page to use

**Evidence:**
```
Suburb page (/pest-control/bondi/):
  - Has "Pricing Guide" section showing services
  - Links to /services/termite-inspection/, /services/cockroach-control/, etc.
  - Content mentions "Termite treatment in Bondi"
  - RESULT: Fragments service page authority

Service page (/services/termite-inspection/):
  - Shows all operators offering termite inspection
  - Has "Popular Locations" showing top 10 suburbs
  - Content is generic "termite inspection in sydney"
  - RESULT: Loses local searches for "termite inspection bondi"
```

**Resolution:** Content isolation strategy
1. Remove service pricing from suburb pages
2. Remove individual service links from suburb pages
3. Keep only generic "View all services" link
4. Service pages stay focused on Sydney-wide service education

**Expected Improvement:** +5-8% traffic to service pages, minimal impact to suburb pages

---

### Issue 3: Operator Pages vs Service Pages (REVENUE IMPACT: MEDIUM)

**Problem:**
- Operator pages list all services they offer with links to service pages
- Service pages list operators offering that service
- Cross-linking prevents both from establishing clear authority

**Evidence:**
```
Operator page (/operator/abc-pest-control/):
  - "Services Offered" section links to each service page
  - Users click away from operator profile
  - Loses potential quote conversions

Service page (/services/termite-inspection/):
  - "Operators Offering Termite Inspection"
  - Shows ABC Pest Control (among others)
  - Unclear if ABC specializes in this service
```

**Resolution:** Remove service cross-linking
1. Show services on operator pages as info cards (no links)
2. Link operators to service pages
3. Single generic "View all services" link on operator pages

**Expected Improvement:** +10-15% operator page CTR, better conversion to quotes

## RISK MITIGATION

### Potential Negative Impacts

- When updating titles/metas, expect 2-4 week volatility
- Mitigation: Monitor closely, don't revert hastily
- Expected: +15-25% volatility, then improvement

**Risk 2: User Navigation Confusion**
- If internal linking changes too much, users might get lost
- Mitigation: Test with small percentage first (50 suburbs)
- Expected: 0-2% bounce rate increase initially

**Risk 3: Redirect Loops**
- If consolidating pages, may create redirect chains
- Mitigation: Direct redirects only, max 1 hop
- Expected: 0% impact if done correctly

**Risk 4: Content Gaps**
- Removing content from suburb pages might lose long-tail keywords
- Mitigation: Keep content, just don't link
- Expected: 0% impact

### Rollback Plan

If negative impact occurs:
1. **Week 1-2:** Monitor without changes
2. **Week 2-3:** Make targeted adjustments (add internal links if needed)
3. **Week 3-4:** If >20% traffic decline, rollback titles/canonicals
4. **Week 4+:** Re-evaluate approach with smaller test

Estimated rollback time: 2-4 hours
