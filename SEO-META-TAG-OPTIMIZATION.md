## ANALYSIS OF CURRENT TAGS

### Homepage
**Current Title**: "Sydney Pest Control Directory"
- **Character Count**: 33 chars ✓ (Well under 60, but lacks keyword)
- **Issue**: No primary keyword "pest control sydney" in title
- **Issue**: Missing power word or emotional trigger

**Current Description**: "Find licensed pest control services near you. Compare quotes from EPA-verified pest controllers across Sydney."
- **Character Count**: 111 chars (Too short - wasting impression space)
- **Missing**: CTA verb, urgency element

---

### Suburb Pages
**Current Title**: "Pest Control {Suburb} - {X} Licensed Operators"
- **Example**: "Pest Control Bondi - 5 Licensed Operators"
- **Character Count**: Variable but good structure (45-55 chars typical)
- **Issue**: Could lead with suburb + keyword combo
- **Strength**: Number creates trust signal

**Current Description**: "Find licensed pest control in {Suburb} {Postcode}. Compare {X}+ EPA-verified operators. {Common pests} treatment. Get free quotes today!"
- **Character Count**: Variable (120-160 chars)
- **Strength**: Includes CTA and social proof
- **Issue**: Sentence structure could be tighter

---

### Service Pages
**Current Title**: "{Service Name} Sydney - {Price Range} | Find Licensed Operators"
- **Example**: "Termite Inspection Sydney - $250-$500 | Find Licensed Operators"
- **Character Count**: 60-70 chars (Slightly over ideal, may truncate)
- **Issue**: Price range takes valuable real estate
- **Issue**: "Find Licensed Operators" may be truncated on mobile

**Current Description**: "Professional {service name} in Sydney. {Description} Compare {X}+ EPA-verified operators. Prices from {Price Range}."
- **Character Count**: 120-150 chars
- **Strength**: Includes price expectations
- **Issue**: "Professional" is weak opener

---

### Operator Pages
**Current Title**: "{Business Name} - EPA Licensed Pest Control"
- **Example**: "ABC Pest Control - EPA Licensed Pest Control"
- **Character Count**: 45-60 chars ✓
- **Strength**: License status in title builds trust
- **Issue**: "EPA Licensed Pest Control" redundant phrasing

**Current Description**: "{Description} ★ {Rating}/5 ({Review Count} reviews). EPA License: {License Number}. Serving {X} Sydney suburbs."
- **Character Count**: 140-160 chars ✓
- **Strength**: Rating emoji and review count
- **Issue**: License number and technical details distract from value prop

---

## KEY FINDINGS

### What's Working
1. ✓ Suburb pages have good local specificity
2. ✓ Service pages include pricing (users search for price)
3. ✓ Operator pages use trust signals (EPA, ratings)
4. ✓ All descriptions include CTAs
5. ✓ EPA verification is emphasized

### What Needs Improvement
1. Homepage lacks primary keyword and character space
2. Service titles may truncate on mobile (67+ chars)
3. Operator titles are generic (all say "EPA Licensed Pest Control")
4. Descriptions miss urgency/emotional triggers
5. No power words across most templates
6. Mobile truncation points not optimized

### Mobile Truncation Reference
- **Desktop**: ~60 characters visible in title, ~160 in description
- **Mobile**: ~30-35 characters visible in title, ~120 in description
- **Current Risk**: Service page titles will show as "[Service] Sydney - [Price] | Find..." with operator part cut off

---

## OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Character Count Best Practices
- **Title**: 50-58 chars (Google's sweet spot for full display)
- **Description**: 155-160 chars (Maximum useful length)
- **Primary keyword**: First 30 chars of title for mobile
- **Call-to-action**: Must appear before character 130 in description

### Power Words to Use
- **Urgency**: Fast, Same-day, Immediate, Emergency, Urgent
- **Social Proof**: Trusted, 4.8★, Top-rated, Verified, Licensed
- **Emotional**: Safe, Protected, Reliable, Professional, Guaranteed
- **Action**: Get, Find, Compare, Book, Request, Call Now

### Local SEO Priorities
1. Suburb name in title (within first 30 chars on mobile)
2. Service area coverage number as trust signal
3. Rating/review count visible in snippet
4. CTA before truncation point

## 5. CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX

### Issue #1: Service Page Title Truncation
**Current**: "{Service Name} Sydney - {Price Range} | Find Licensed Operators"
- Example: "Termite Inspection Sydney - $250-$500 | Find Licensed Operators" (72 chars)
- Mobile display: "Termite Inspection Sydney - $250-$500 | Find..." (truncates "Licensed Operators")

**Fix**: Remove "| Find Licensed Operators" and use Option A template above

### Issue #2: Operator Title Redundancy
**Current**: "{Business Name} - EPA Licensed Pest Control"
- This repeats "Pest Control" (already the site domain context)
- Wastes characters that could differentiate the operator

**Fix**: Add location "{Business Name} - Licensed Pest Control {Suburb}" to improve local SEO

### Issue #3: Homepage Keyword Gap
**Current**: "Sydney Pest Control Directory"
- Missing "pest control sydney" primary keyword
- Not optimized for "find pest control" searches

**Fix**: Use Option A or C for homepage (both include primary keyword)

### Issue #4: Description CTA Timing
**Current**: Some descriptions end with CTA, others bury it mid-text
- Google shows first 120 chars on mobile

**Fix**: All CTAs should appear before character 130 in description

---

## URL STRUCTURE RECOMMENDATIONS

### Current Structure
```
/pest-control/[suburb]
/services/[service]
/operator/[slug]
```

### Optimization Opportunities

**Suburb Pages** ✓
- Current: `/pest-control/bondi` - Good (keyword-focused)
- Consider: `/pest-control/bondi-2026` (adds postcode for uniqueness)
- Impact: Helps differentiate similar suburb names

**Service Pages** ✓
- Current: `/services/termite-inspection` - Good (service + location in title)
- No change needed

**Operator Pages** ✓
- Current: `/operator/[slug]` - Acceptable
- Consider: `/operators/[suburb]/[slug]` (local clustering for location queries)
- Impact: Better for "pest control [suburb]" searches
- Note: Requires sitemap restructuring

**New: Location Pages** 🎯
- Consider: `/pest-control/[region]/[suburb]`
- Benefit: Improve regional keyword ranking (e.g., "eastern suburbs pest control")
- Current: Region pages exist at `/locations/[region]` - Good fallback
