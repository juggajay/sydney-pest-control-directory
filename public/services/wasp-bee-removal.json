  "longDescription": "Wasps and bees near high-traffic areas of your property pose a real sting risk, particularly for those with allergies. Paper wasps, European wasps, and native bees are common in Sydney. Professional removal ensures safety and, where possible for bees, humane relocation. European wasp nests in particular can contain thousands of aggressive wasps and require expert treatment.",

      "question": "What's the difference between wasps and bees?",
      "answer": "Wasps are generally slimmer with bright yellow and black markings and can sting multiple times. Bees are furrier, less aggressive, and die after stinging. Paper wasps build exposed umbrella-shaped nests while European wasps nest in cavities. Honey bees form larger hives in cavities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I try to remove a wasp nest myself?",
      "answer": "We strongly advise against DIY wasp nest removal, especially for European wasp nests which can be extremely aggressive. Disturbing a nest can trigger mass stinging. Professional pest controllers have protective equipment and effective treatments for safe removal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can bees be relocated instead of killed?",
      "answer": "Where possible, we prefer to relocate bee colonies to beekeepers. However, this depends on location, species, and accessibility. Sometimes safe removal isn't possible and treatment is necessary. We'll discuss options and prioritise bee preservation where viable."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the risk of European wasps?",
      "answer": "European wasps are highly aggressive when disturbed, can sting multiple times, and nests can contain thousands of wasps. They're attracted to food and drinks, making outdoor eating areas dangerous. Their ground nests are often disturbed accidentally. Professional removal is essential."
