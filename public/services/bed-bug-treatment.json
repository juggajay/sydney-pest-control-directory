      "question": "How did I get bed bugs?",
      "answer": "Bed bugs are excellent hitchhikers. They commonly travel in luggage from hotels, in second-hand furniture, or from adjacent apartments in multi-unit buildings. Having bed bugs is not a reflection of cleanliness - they're found in all types of accommodation from budget to 5-star."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will one treatment eliminate bed bugs?",
      "answer": "Most bed bug infestations require 2-3 treatments spaced about 2 weeks apart. This is because eggs are resistant to many treatments and hatch over time. Follow-up treatments catch newly hatched bed bugs before they can reproduce. We'll advise on the specific treatment plan for your situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to throw away my mattress?",
      "answer": "In most cases, no. Professional treatment can effectively eliminate bed bugs from mattresses. However, severely infested or damaged mattresses may be better replaced. We'll advise based on inspection findings. Using mattress encasements after treatment helps prevent future problems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can bed bugs spread disease?",
      "answer": "While bed bug bites are irritating and can cause allergic reactions in some people, bed bugs are not known to transmit diseases to humans. The main concerns are the physical and psychological discomfort they cause, plus the difficulty of elimination without professional help."
