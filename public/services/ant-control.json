  "shortDescription": "Effective ant elimination targeting the colony",
  "longDescription": "Ants are social insects that live in large colonies, making DIY treatments often ineffective. Professional ant control identifies the species (crucial for effective treatment), locates nests, and uses targeted products that workers carry back to the colony. Sydney homes commonly deal with Black house ants, Coastal brown ants, and occasionally destructive species like Carpenter ants.",

    {
      "question": "Why do ants keep coming back after I spray them?",
      "answer": "Surface sprays only kill the ants you see, which is a tiny fraction of the colony. The queen continues producing eggs. Professional treatments use baits that foraging ants carry back to the nest, eventually eliminating the colony including the queen. This provides lasting control."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there ants in Sydney that damage timber?",
      "answer": "Yes, Carpenter ants can cause significant damage to timber structures. Unlike termites, they don't eat wood but excavate it for nesting, leaving behind sawdust-like frass. If you see large black ants near timber with small piles of debris, contact a professional for inspection."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does ant treatment take to work?",
      "answer": "You should notice a significant reduction in ant activity within 1-2 weeks. The baits take time to be carried back to the nest and spread through the colony. Avoid spraying ants yourself during this period as it can interfere with the bait's effectiveness."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do I get ants inside after it rains?",
      "answer": "Rain floods ant nests, forcing them to seek dry shelter - often your home. This is common in Sydney, especially in areas with clay soils. A perimeter treatment creates a barrier that intercepts ants trying to enter, rain or shine."
