    {
      "question": "What deterrent methods are available?",
      "answer": "Options include bird spikes (physical barrier), netting (exclusion), wire systems (prevents landing), visual deterrents, and sonic devices. The best solution depends on the bird species, location, and your specific situation. We'll recommend the most effective and cost-efficient option for your property."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are bird deterrents humane?",
      "answer": "Yes, modern bird deterrents are designed to discourage birds without harming them. Spikes and wire systems simply prevent landing and are not sharp enough to injure birds. Netting excludes birds from areas. The goal is to make your property less attractive than alternative roosting sites."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can bird droppings be dangerous?",
      "answer": "Yes, bird droppings can carry over 60 diseases transmissible to humans, including Histoplasmosis and Cryptococcosis. Dried droppings become airborne and can be inhaled. Additionally, droppings are highly acidic and cause damage to building materials, paint, and vehicles."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the birds just move somewhere else on my building?",
      "answer": "Good bird control anticipates this. We assess your entire property and recommend protection for all potential roosting sites. Simply treating one area often moves the problem elsewhere. A comprehensive solution addresses all vulnerable areas."
