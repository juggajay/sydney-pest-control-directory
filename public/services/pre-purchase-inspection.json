      "question": "When should I book a pre-purchase inspection?",
      "answer": "Book as soon as your offer is accepted, during the cooling-off period. This gives you time to receive the report, understand the findings, and make decisions before the purchase becomes unconditional. We offer rapid turnaround times to meet tight settlement deadlines."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between building and pest inspections?",
      "answer": "Building inspections assess structural elements, compliance, and general condition. Pest inspections specifically look for evidence of termites and other wood-destroying pests, past damage, and risk factors. Both are recommended for a complete picture. We can often coordinate with building inspectors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can past termite damage be a deal-breaker?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. Well-treated past damage may be acceptable if structural repairs were done properly and ongoing protection is in place. Our report identifies the extent of damage and whether treatment appears adequate. This information helps you make an informed decision or negotiate."
    },
    {
      "question": "What areas can't be inspected?",
      "answer": "We can only inspect accessible areas. Furniture, stored items, fixed linings, and concealed spaces can't be visually assessed without moving or removing them. Our reports clearly note areas that couldn't be inspected and any associated risks. Sellers should provide access where possible."
