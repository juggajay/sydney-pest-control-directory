      "question": "Why do I have cockroaches even though my house is clean?",
      "answer": "Cockroaches can enter the cleanest homes through drains, gaps around pipes, or in groceries and packaging. German cockroaches in particular can hitchhike into properties. While cleanliness helps, professional treatment is often needed to eliminate established populations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between German and Australian cockroaches?",
      "answer": "German cockroaches are small (12-15mm), light brown, and live entirely indoors, often in kitchens and bathrooms. They breed rapidly and are harder to control. Australian cockroaches are larger (30-35mm), darker, and typically live outdoors but enter homes seeking food and water."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will one treatment eliminate all cockroaches?",
      "answer": "For German cockroaches, multiple treatments are often needed due to their rapid breeding cycle. The first treatment kills adults and nymphs, but eggs may hatch afterward. Follow-up treatments ensure complete elimination. Australian cockroaches often respond well to a single treatment with ongoing prevention."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are cockroach treatments safe for food preparation areas?",
      "answer": "Yes, professional cockroach treatments are designed to be safe for use in kitchens. Gel baits are applied in concealed areas away from food contact surfaces. We'll advise on any brief waiting period before using treated areas."
