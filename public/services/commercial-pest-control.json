      "question": "How often do commercial premises need pest control?",
      "answer": "Frequency depends on your industry and pest pressure. Food businesses typically require monthly service as a minimum. Offices might need quarterly treatments. We'll assess your specific situation and recommend an appropriate schedule that meets both regulatory requirements and practical needs."
    },

      "question": "Can you provide documentation for health inspections?",
      "answer": "Yes, we provide comprehensive service reports including dates, treatments performed, products used, and pest activity findings. These reports are designed to meet NSW Food Authority and council inspection requirements. Digital reports can be provided for easy record-keeping."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer emergency call-outs for businesses?",
      "answer": "Yes, we understand that pest issues in commercial settings can't wait. We offer rapid response for urgent situations like rodent sightings in food premises or wasp nests near customer areas. Many service agreements include priority emergency response."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can treatment be done outside business hours?",
      "answer": "Yes, we regularly service businesses after hours to minimise disruption to operations. For restaurants, healthcare facilities, and retail, after-hours service is often preferred. We'll work with your schedule to find the least disruptive timing."
