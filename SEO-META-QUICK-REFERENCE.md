### Description Length

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

| ❌ DON'T | ✓ DO | WHY |
|---------|------|-----|
| All caps titles | Title case (Capitalize Each Word) | Looks spammy, lower CTR |
| Keyword stuffing | Natural language, 1-2 keywords | Google penalizes stuffing |
| Duplicate descriptions | Unique value per page | Reduces impressions |
| No CTA in description | Action verb in first 130 chars | 15% lower CTR |
| Prices in service titles | Include in description only | Causes truncation |
| No location (suburb pages) | Location in first 35 chars | Mobile users need it first |
| All punctuation marks | Minimal pipes/special chars | Breaks formatting in snippets |
| Counting reviews in title | Mention in description | Wastes precious title space |
| "Professional" as opener | Power words: Get, Find, Compare | Generic, low trust |
| Same title template | Variation by page type | Improves scannability |

---

## MOBILE TRUNCATION REFERENCE

### How Google Shows Meta Tags on Mobile

**Title Truncation Points:**
```
Desktop:   "Pest Control Sydney - Find Licensed EPA Operators"
                                ^-- full 49 chars visible

Mobile:    "Pest Control Sydney -..."
           ^-- only ~30-35 chars visible
```

**Description Truncation Points:**
```
Desktop:   "Get licensed pest control in Sydney in 48 hours. Compare 100+ EPA-verified operators..."
           ^-- ~160 chars visible

Mobile:    "Get licensed pest control in Sydney in 48 hours. Compare 100+ EPA-v..."
           ^-- ~120 chars visible
```

**Critical Checkpoint**: If your CTA appears after character 120 in description, mobile users won't see it.

## CHARACTER COUNT TOOL (Manual)

Can't use an online tool? Count like this:

1. Copy your title/description
2. Paste into: https://www.charactercounttool.com/
3. Or count manually: each letter, number, space = 1 character
4. Special characters (★, $, -) = 1 character each
5. Emoji/symbols = 2-3 characters

**Quick Check**: 50-60 chars for title = roughly 8-10 words

---

## FAQ

**Q: Should I use ★ or "star"?**
A: Use ★ emoji for uniqueness in SERP (especially operator pages). Google displays it fine on mobile. Avoid in other pages where it might display as box.

**Q: Can I include phone number?**
A: No - wastes valuable space. Google shows click-to-call automatically from structured data.

**Q: How often to change meta tags?**
A: Every 3-6 months after A/B testing. Don't change weekly. Google needs time to see impact.

**Q: What if description is exactly 160 chars?**
A: Perfect. Google won't truncate at exactly 160. 161+ has risk.

**Q: Should suburb postcode be in title or description?**
A: Description only. Saves title space for keyword + count + modifier.

**Q: How long until ranking improves?**
A: Click-through rate improves in days (better snippets). Rankings improve in 3-4 weeks (after Google re-crawl and sees CTR increase).
